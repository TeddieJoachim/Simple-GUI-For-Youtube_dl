# Simple-GUI-For-Youtube_dl

# Hopefully this is fairly easy to use, it has a few quirks as of now. When downloading playlists, 
# after the first video is added to the queue, you have to click seek all to add the rest of the playlist to the queue.
# If an error occurs in the middle of a playlist, you will also have to seek all to retrive what was downloaded, and either delete
# the videos from the youtube playlist that have already been downloaded and give it the same URL, or manually download each individual video.
# I will include directions on how to clone it/set it up so you can try it out once I figure that out!
