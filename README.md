# Simple-GUI-For-Youtube_dl

 Hopefully this is fairly easy to use, it has a few quirks as of now. When downloading playlists, 
 after the first video is added to the queue, you have to click seek all to add the rest of the playlist to the queue.
 If an error occurs in the middle of a playlist, you will also have to seek all to retrive what was downloaded, and either delete
 the videos from the youtube playlist that have already been downloaded and give it the same URL, or manually download each individual video.

Cloning the Repository

First, navigate to the directory that you would like to clone the repository into using commands like:
cd: to change your working directory.
cd ../ to "go back" a level in your directory tree.
(or mkdir to create a new one! If it is a git repository, I believe you will need to use the command git init inside the directory)
Next, clone the remote repository and create a local copy on your machine using this command:
git clone https://github.com/TeddieJoachim/Simple-GUI-For-Youtube_dl.git
Now you can see the contents of the remote repository on your machine by moving into the newly cloned directory.

To update your local git directory:
-git pull

Note on git pull errors: You may get a git pull error if you have made changes to files in your local git directory. This is ok, and normal. If you get an error when you pull (or update) the repo that says something like "Your local changes to the following files will be overwritten by mergeâ€™", you can do a git stash to address this. To find out how to do this, go to https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Tools-Stashing to read all about it.


I believe that in order to make changes, you will have to request a key from me, feel free to! This is my first git repo, not giving access to the public to make changes is nothing personal haha.
